<h2> Thick Cut French Toast </h2>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
	<li> 1 stick of butter </li>
	<li> 3 Whole large eggs </li>
	<li> 1 Tbsp vanilla </li>
	<li> 1/4 cup of cinnamon </li>
	<li> 1/2 cup of heavy cream </li>
	<li> Whole loaf of thick bread like brioche or challah </li>
</ul>

<h4> Cooking Procedure </h4>
<ol>
	<li> Preheat oven to 350F and set a gridded rack or tray off to the side of where you will be cooking with your pan.</li>
	<li> Slice roughly 4 1/2 inch thick slices of the bread. </li>
	<li> In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together the eggs and heavy cream. Add the vanilla and cinnamon. </li>
	<li> Heat about 4 tbsp of butter in a non-stick or properly seasoned carbon steel pan. Add more butter after each slice or set of sclices is cooked. </li>
	<li> Thoroughly soak the bread in the custard and lay down away from you on the pan. Depending on the size of the pan, one to three slices may fit comfortably. </li>
	<li> Cook until golden brown and place the slice/slices on the rack that was set aside. This rack can be tossed in to the oven to keep the french toast warm and even cook it a little more as you cook the remaining slices. </li>
</ol>
